Developed an R-Shiny application employing Descriptive and Predictive Analytics to estimate the probability of attrition of an employee based on numerous input factors. Attrition rates are on the rise and this is an alarming concern for most companies. In such a fast-paced work environment, it is necessary for companies to know what to expect from their employees. This case study is targeted towards analysing the trends of factors impacting attrition and help companies understand the changes that need to be made in order to curb attrition. The dataset used for the analysis, which represents employee data from XYZ Company, is from Kaggle. The DSS that is built from this dataset has a model which is developed through exploratory data analysis, data manipulation and predictive modelling. The User Interface component enables a stakeholder to visualize current categories of employees causing high attrition rates. It also takes the details of an employee as input to predict the probability of attrition.
